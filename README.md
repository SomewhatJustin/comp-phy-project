# Ant Colony Optimization: AntNet
## Max Demarr, Brendan Oloughlin, Justin Fowler

The file "ant_sim.ipynb" details the project in full, including background, algorithms and applications.
The file "router.py" is a python script implementing the methods of ACO.

# Implementation of AntNet
This project works with software packages developed in the field of Ant Colony Optimization (ACO). We reimplemented a specific application of ACO called AntNet. The original package was implemented in [Omnet++](https://omnetpp.org/), which is a C++ simulation library. We sought to provide a modern, more user friendly, implementation in python.
